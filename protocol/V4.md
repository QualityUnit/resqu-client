# Protocol V4

Prefix: `resqu-v4`

## Job
Job is a smallest work unit in resqu. It is enqueued for execution by pushing json payload into a redis key specified by this protocol.

Lifecycle of a job:
1. Job payload is enqueued (client-side)
2. Worker retrieves the job payload from queue
3. Worker initializes environment and attempts to include path specified in the payload
4. Worker attempts to create task class and call it to perform the job
5. (OPTIONALLY) Job is rescheduled
    - Reschedule determines success or fail of current job
6. Job finishes
    - As a fail (Error is thrown from the task instance, or reschedule is marked as fail)
    - As a success 
    
### Rescheduling
Every job has the ability to reschedule itself as the same, or completely different job.  
Reschedule (fail) can be used as a retry mechanism.  
Reschedule (success) can be used to split bigger workloads.

### Unique jobs and deferral
Every job can be made unique by specifying its **unique id**. It is assumed that 2 jobs with the same **unique id** will perform exactly the same task and are therefore interchangeable.  
No two unique jobs with same **unique id** can be enqueued at the same time. This applies both to regular and delayed queue, as well as running jobs.  
Planned jobs with set **unique id** will not be enqueued if their uniqueness check fails, but their plan will be moved towards next enqueue point.

It is possible to enqueue a unique job even if a job with the same **unique id** is already running.  
It can be achieved by setting its deferral delay.  
Deferred jobs will be enqueued as soon as the job blocking them is done executing. This can optionally be delayed if positive deferral delay is specified.

## Enqueuing standard jobs




### Uniqueness check
Check for uniqueness and deferral is performed by client when enqueuing a job.


### Job payload
```json
{
    "class": "\\Example\\JobWrapper",
    "sourceId": "u145680",
    "args": {
        "argument1": "value1",
        "arg2": [1, 2, 3]
    },
    "name": "\\Example\\Jobs\\MailJob",
    "unique": {
        "uid": "mailjob-load-4c583f9g",
        "deferrableBy": 30
    },
    "isMonitored": true,
    "includePath": "scripts/job_bootstrap.php",
    "environment": {
        "PROJECT_ACCOUNTS_PATH": "/opt/app/accounts"
    }
}
```
| Paramenter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **class** | *MANDATORY* | Full name of a job class implementing `ITask` interface |
| **sourceId** | *MANDATORY* | Identifier of a unique job source. Should be the same for all jobs enqueued by the same client/app instance. |
| **args** | - | Named arguments available to a task instance in perform |
| **name** | same as **class** | Identifier of a unique task performed by a job. Useful if main class can execute multiple different job types. |
| **unique** | - | Object used to describe unique jobs (check **Unique jobs and deferral** below) |
| **unique.uid** | *MANDATORY FOR UNIQUE JOBS* | Uniquely identifies job, no other job with the same ID can be enqueued while existing did not finish. |
| **unique.deferrableBy** | *MANDATORY FOR DEFERRABLE JOBS* | Deferral delay in seconds. Set to 0 for instant deferred enqueue. Negative values are normalized to 0. |
| **isMonitored** | `false` | Whether or not individual job monitoring is enabled |
| **includePath** | - | If present, it will be appended to base path present in server config and an attempt to load the file before job execution will be made. |
| **environment** | - | Named arguments to be loaded into $_SERVER before job execution. This happens *before* **includePath** is loaded. |
